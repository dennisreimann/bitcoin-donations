  "description": "I'm a Bitcoin Core full time developer and maintainer. I discovered Bitcoin in 2011. My first Bitcoin Core contribution goes back to 2013. In total, I contributed over 30'000 lines of code in over 500 commits (at least twice as much was written but never made it to the master branch). I'm currently working on BIP324 - a p2p transport layer encryption as well as on a SPV mode for Bitcoin Core. Around 50% of my spent time goes into maintaining Bitcoin Core (reviewing, testing, commenting). I run [bitcoinbuilds.org](https://bitcoinbuilds.org) as well as the [nightly gitian builds](https://bitcoin.jonasschnelli.ch/gitian)",
