   "description": "Independent Bitcoin Core contributor focusing on security. Found CVE-2017-18350, CVE-2018-20586, CVE-2019-18936 and some fixed but yet to be announced vulns. Plans to help Bitcoin stay secure for decades to come by a.) killing vulns (auditing/fuzzing), b.) killing bug classes (mitigations), c.) improving security processes (tooling/automation) and d.) raising C++ secure coding awareness (education/review). Loyal to Bitcoiners *only*: not to corporations or cliques. Trying to stay 100% independent. See GitHub profile for HODL-only donation address :)",
